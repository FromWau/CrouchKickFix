# Crouch Kick Fix

8ms input buffer for crouch kicks - makes them way easier to hit consistently.

Standalone extraction of the crouch kick fix from [TF2SR-Menu-Mod](https://github.com/zweek/TF2SR-Menu-Mod) (the [official speedrun mod](https://tf2sr.github.io/TF2SR-Wiki/docs/tutorials/welcome/additional-tools#speedrun-mod)).

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> **This mod requires manual installation!**
> You must copy `midimap.dll` to your Titanfall2 root directory (next to Titanfall2.exe)

1. Put `midimap.dll` in your Titanfall2 folder (next to Titanfall2.exe)
2. Put `mods/FromWau.CrouchKickFix/` in `R2Northstar/mods/`

You'll see "CKF ENABLED" in green on screen when it's working.
